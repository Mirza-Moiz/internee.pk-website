# Internee.pk Website Redesign

This repository contains the code for the redesigned website of [internee.pk](https://internee.pk), which I developed as part of my React internship.

## Project Overview

As an intern at Internee.pk, I had the opportunity to work on redesigning their website. The project involved several key tasks:

- **Responsive Design**: Developed the frontend using React to ensure a responsive design that works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive User Interfaces**: Created dynamic user interfaces using React components.
- **Animations and Transitions**: Implemented animations and transitions to enhance user engagement and interactivity.
- **Navigation Menu**: Designed a user-friendly navigation menu that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Interactive Features**: Integrated React components to add interactive features such as contact forms, sliders, and dynamic content loading.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implemented client-side validation for user inputs to improve user experience and data integrity.
- **Frontend Collaboration**: Collaborated with other frontend technologies like HTML and CSS to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Testing**: Conducted thorough testing of the React components to identify and fix any issues.
- **Documentation**: Provided documentation for React component development and usage.
